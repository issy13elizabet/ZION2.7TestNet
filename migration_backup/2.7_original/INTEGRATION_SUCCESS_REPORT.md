## ðŸ”§ What Was Integrated

### 1. Enhanced Blockchain Core (`core/blockchain.py`)
- **CryptoNote-Compatible Data Structures**: Block and Tx classes enhanced with CryptoNote fields
- **Advanced Consensus Parameters**: Halving logic, enhanced difficulty, supply limits
- **Performance Tracking**: Comprehensive blockchain statistics and monitoring
- **Cumulative Difficulty**: Advanced difficulty tracking system

### 2. Zero-Dependency RPC Server (`rpc/simple_server.py`)
- **JSON-RPC 2.0 Compatible**: Full CryptoNote-compatible API
- **Mining Support**: getblocktemplate, submitblock endpoints
- **Monitoring**: getinfo, getheight, stats endpoints
- **No External Dependencies**: Uses only Python standard library

### 3. Enhanced Features From 2.6.75
- **Block Structure**: major_version, minor_version, base_reward, block_size, cumulative_difficulty
- **Transaction Structure**: version, unlock_time, extra, signatures, tx_size, ring_size
- **Consensus Enhancements**: CryptoNote parameters, halving intervals, enhanced difficulty calculation
- **Performance Metrics**: Comprehensive blockchain information system
