# Simple Migration Execution Summary

Objective: Provide a minimal, runnable 2.6.5 testnet skeleton integrating core, pool (Stratum), miner, and frontend with consistent versioning and simplified Docker orchestration.

## Completed Actions

1. Root `VERSION` file established as single source of truth (2.6.5).
2. Core TypeScript service with Express health endpoint.
3. Embedded minimal Stratum server (subscribe, authorize, submit, periodic job notify).
4. Job Engine placeholder: 30s rotation, random template broadcast.
5. Genesis + network config scaffolding (`config/network`).
6. Miner C++ sources migrated (builds via CMake; validation logic pending).
7. Frontend (Next.js) ported intact.
8. CI workflow: builds core + miner, health-checks core.
9. Docker multi-service setup (`docker-compose.yml`) for core, miner, frontend.
10. Environment variable support added for core & Stratum ports and initial difficulty.
11. Added lightweight Node type shims (to be replaced by `@types/node`).
12. Documentation: `DOCKER_GUIDE.md` (current doc) & this summary.

## What Is Deliberately Minimal / Placeholder

- Consensus & blockchain state (no real chain sync, height fixed conceptually at genesis).
- Block template & coinbase assembly (random bytes used as template placeholder).
- Difficulty / target calculation (static initial difficulty only).
- Share validation (all submissions currently accepted).
- Duplicate share detection & per-connection statistics.
- Wallet adapter integration / payouts logic.
- Seed node orchestration & peer discovery.

## Immediate Next Recommended Steps

1. Implement share validation pipeline (header assembly + hash target compare).
2. Introduce dynamic difficulty (vardiff) and send `mining.set_difficulty` updates.
3. Replace random template with real block header builder referencing genesis + mempool.
4. Add CI step running a lightweight Stratum integration test (subscribe + first notify).
5. Harden types by installing `@types/node` & enabling stricter TypeScript options.
6. Introduce `legacy/` directory in old repo & mark deprecated components.

## Upgrade Path Notes

As soon as real template generation lands, miners will require updated parameter semantics (merkle branches, nTime/nbits). Communicate upcoming changes in `CHANGELOG.md` before rollout.

## Rollback Strategy

Because this is an additive skeleton separate from original 2.6 backups, rollback = checkout of `v2.6-backup-final` tag in the legacy repo. No destructive migrations performed here.

## Acceptance Criteria Met

- Single version source unified.
- End-to-end container stack starts and responds to `/healthz`.
- Miner can connect and receive `mining.notify` messages.
- Documentation enumerates placeholders & next steps.
